# Spectral-Based-Feature-Extraction-Sitar
These were the programs used for the purpose of my final year project thesis.
Analysis Folder consists of 3 main programs

1.) SitarAudio10code is a program for calculating the overall and frame by frame Fret features for 10 instances of each Fret.

2.) Each_Fret is a program for calculating and analysing the Spectral Features for overall and frame by frame of each Fret from the sample signal.

3.) Full_frets is a program for calculating the Spectral Features for overall and frame by frame for comparison between the feature values of 19 frets from the sample signal.


Classification Folder consists of Neural Network Trainer for different feature vector sets.
Run the program NN_Trainer and input the feature vector datasets
